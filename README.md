Creating a professional `README.md` for your Streamlit project based on the final, corrected code and observed issues.

This README provides clear instructions, highlights the dependencies, and documents the critical vocabulary size issue.

# üè• Medical Image Report Generator (Transformer-based)

This project implements an Image Captioning model using a **Vision Encoder-Decoder** (EfficientNet + Transformer) architecture to generate preliminary diagnostic reports for frontal Chest X-ray images. The application is built using **Streamlit** for an interactive, web-based user interface.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Warning: Vocabulary Mismatch

Based on the loading errors, the provided `word2idx.pkl` file **does not match** the expected size of the trained model checkpoint (`medical_report_model.pt`).

  * **Model Expected Vocabulary Size:** **1810**
  * **Loaded Vocabulary Size:** **15** (from the corrupted `.pkl` file)

The application code includes a **workaround** to force the model to load, but the generated reports will be **inaccurate** or **nonsensical** until the correct `word2idx.pkl` file (containing 1810 entries) is replaced.

## üöÄ Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the Streamlit application.

### 1\. Prerequisites

You must have Python installed (3.8+ recommended).

### 2\. Required Files

Ensure the following files are placed in the root directory of your project:

| File Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `streamlit_app.py` | The main application code (the "fully enhanced code"). |
| `medical_report_model.pt` | The pre-trained PyTorch model checkpoint. |
| `word2idx.pkl` | The vocabulary dictionary file (currently corrupted/incomplete). |

### 3\. Install Dependencies

Create and activate a virtual environment, then install the necessary libraries from a `requirements.txt` file (or install them directly):

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: .\venv\Scripts\activate

# Install PyTorch and core libraries
# Note: Adjust torch/torchvision based on your system (CPU/GPU)
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio

# Install the other dependencies
pip install streamlit pillow numpy nltk efficientnet-pytorch
```

**Recommended `requirements.txt`:**

```
streamlit
torch
torchvision
torchaudio
Pillow
numpy
nltk
efficientnet-pytorch
```

-----

## üèÉ Running the Application

Once the dependencies are installed and the required files are present, start the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

The application will launch in your web browser, typically at `http://localhost:8501`.

-----

## üíª Code Structure & Model Architecture

The core of the application is defined by several PyTorch modules:

  * **`ImageEncoder`**: Uses a pre-trained **EfficientNet-B4** to extract image features.
  * **`TransformerEncoderBlock`**: Processes the flattened image features.
  * **`PositionalEmbedding`**: Generates token and positional embeddings for the captions.
  * **`TransformerDecoderBlock`**: Performs masked self-attention and cross-attention (with image features).
  * **`CaptionDecoder`**: Stacks multiple Decoder Blocks to generate the output sequence.
  * **`ImageCaptioningModel`**: The main sequence-to-sequence model class.

### Key Model Details:

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Encoder Backbone** | EfficientNet-B4 | Pre-trained on ImageNet. |
| **Embedding Dimension** (`EMBED_DIM`) | 512 | Feature size throughout the Transformer. |
| **Feed Forward Dimension** (`FF_DIM`) | 512 | Inner dimension of the FFN. |
| **Attention Heads** (`NUM_HEADS`) | 8 | Number of attention heads. |
| **Decoder Layers** (`NUM_DECODER_LAYERS`) | 4 | Number of stacked Transformer Decoder blocks. |
| **Generation Method** | Beam Search (default: 3) | Used for generating coherent captions. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Troubleshooting and Development

### 1\. Model Loading Errors (`size mismatch`)

If the size mismatch error persists:

  * **Cause:** Your `word2idx.pkl` file is fundamentally wrong and only contains a few words (current size is 15), while the model expects **1810**.
  * **Solution:** You must **find and replace** the `word2idx.pkl` file with the correct version that was generated during the training phase.

### 2\. Streamlit Caching Error (`Cannot hash argument 'tokenizer'`)

*(This has been fixed in the final code, but for reference):*

  * **Cause:** Streamlit cannot hash a custom Python object (`Tokenizer`) passed as an argument to a cached function (`load_model`).
  * **Solution:** The argument name in the `load_model` function signature was changed from `tokenizer` to **`_tokenizer`** to tell Streamlit to ignore it for caching purposes.

### 3\. NLTK Download

If you see an error about NLTK resources:

  * **Cause:** The `nltk` library requires the `punkt` tokenizer data.
  * **Solution:** Ensure you have an internet connection and the `nltk.download('punkt')` line in the script successfully runs on first execution.
